<strong>About the Project</strong>

<p>A record of the physical structures and open areas dedicated to instruction, housing, the arts, athletics, and recreation is vital to understanding an institution like Oberlin College.  While the Oberlin College Archives has campus maps that have been created through the years by different departments for various audiences and purposes, this site provides a map of the Oberlin College campus for each year from 1833 to 2023, on the same basemap, making it possible for anyone with an interest in Oberlin’s rich history to track changes in the built environment and see the evolution of the footprint of the College over time.</p>


<strong>Project Team</strong>
<p>The original conception for the map sequence was by Lee C. Drickamer (OC 1967) who is Regents’ Professor Emeritus of Biological Sciences at Northern Arizona University. He returned to Oberlin in retirement to work on several history book projects. Clara Margaret Flood (OC 2018) is the person most responsible for the overall design and execution of the complete dossier of maps. She is an Instructor and Laboratory Manager in the Department of Geosciences at Oberlin. Clara Margaret holds a master’s degree from the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Her research interests include GIS, web applications of GIS, and cartography. It is typical of Oberlin that two alumni, who graduated 51 years apart, to find a useful collaboration such as this project. </p>
